The original J2EE specification was developed by Sun Microsystems.

Starting with J2EE 1.3, the specification was developed under the Java Community Process.
JSR 58 specifies J2EE 1.3 and JSR 151 specifies the J2EE 1.4 specification.

## Hello World [J2EE 1.3]

Based on the archetype https://maven.apache.org/archetypes/maven-archetype-j2ee-simple/ with slight changes,this is a 
J2EE example application that follows the J2EE Blueprints series to create a J2EE enterprise application.

The purpose of this application is to demonstrate the capabilities of the J2EE platform and is written
for learning purposes (for example to illustrate the many different design patterns on various part of J2EE).
It is not coded for performance and is not intended for performance benchmarks.

The application follows the J2EE 1.3 specs which is a set of related specifications and can be seen as a single
standard for implementing and deploying enterprise applications. it also demonstrates the following:

How to use Java Server Pages (jsp).
How to use Java Servlets.
How to use Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB).
How to use Java Message Service (JMS).
How to use JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL).
How to use the Java API for XML-based RPC (JAX-RPC).
How to use SOAP.
How to exchange and process XML-based documents.
How to develop flexible, scalable, cross-plaform enterprise applications.
How to use the Java BluePrints guidelines and patterns.

Illustrate basic usage of J2EE technology with current best practices, such as:
- JSF 1.1
- MyFaces 1.1.8
- Struts
- JSP
- Junit 3.8 && JMock 1.2 [Java 1.4]

The "Hello World" example application can be deployed in OC4J [oc4j_extended_101350] and JBoss [3.2.8]
